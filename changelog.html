<li>2005/3/25 - I added a <a href="translations.html">page</a> to show who's working on a translation of the guide into another language. Nobody yet but I hope some people will take on the offer!</li>
<li>2005/3/21 - I made some hiragana and katakana exercises. It's currently only tested with firefox so if you have problems with the javascript let me know. I hope to make continue making more
practice exercises like this in the future as time allows.</li>
<li>2005/3/16 - The <a href="tendency.html">new section</a> has been finished.</li>
<li>2005/3/15 - Ok, it's been over a month with no updates so I'm putting up the new section even though it's not finished. I hope you enjoy and I'll finish it up soon!</li>
<li>2005/2/12 - Changed the <a href="conditional.html#part3">なら</a> explanation (Thanks to Murao-san for pointing out that it's not always decided and other pointers.)</li>
<li>2005/1/13 - I've been working on this one for awhile, but the <a href="should.html">new section</a> is up. As usual, expect some typos as it's a first draft.</li>
<li>2005/1/7 - I wrote up a little perl script to merge the seperate html files into one easy to edit <a href="completeguide.html">monster file</a>.</li>
<li>2004/12/3 - Ok, the <a href="feasibility.html">new section</a> has been finished, though, it could use a bit more examples.</li>
<li>2004/11/28 - I put up the beginning of the next section but it's still not finished.</li>
<li>2004/11/21 - Revised and expanded the <a href="honorhum.html">honorific/humble</a> section.</li>
<li>2004/11/16 - I drew up a little favicon for the site. It's the 「文」 character meaning "sentence"  with a rising sun in the background.
「文」 is also the first half of the word for grammar （文法）. Check it out in your bookmark! (You do have this site bookmarked, right?)</li>
<li>2004/11/14 - It's been many months but I finally put the <a href="signs.html">next section up</a>. It's still a first draft, so please excuse any typos!</li>
<li>2004/10/12 - For those of you in doubt, yes, I'm still working on this guide though I can only afford to spend a few minutes a day due to a shortage of free time.
I have just started adding popup tool-tips that show the reading and meaning of every Japanese word in the examples. It seems like the perfect compromise between spoon feeding
the reading of kanji every time (which will become a crutch and lets you get away with never learning kanji) and forcing even complete beginners to continuously look up every single word (which is frustrating).
Now, if you know all the words, everything is the same as before. However, if you run into a word you don't know, you can just hold the mouse cursor over it for a few seconds and the reading and meaning
will pop up. Of course, you really should look up each new kanji for its readings and stroke order but this will allow people even with a limited vocabulary to read through the lessons more smoothly.
With <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>, the word that is translated will also be highlighted upon the mouse over.
It doesn't look like IE supports this, though. I have finished the basic grammar section and plan to do a lesson a day for the rest.</li>
<li>2004/06/07 - Removed all that nonsense about copula verbs, which was confusing and not helpful in the slightest.</li>
<li>2004/06/05 - I have updated this site to the new 2.0 Creative Commons License. This means that besides the provision that copyright notices must not be
removed, it also means that all copies or derivative works must have a clear link back to this site like so:
<a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/">Tae Kim's Japanese Grammar Guide</a>. I'm currently up to my eyeballs in "real" work so please be patient
for new updates until I can get some time for myself the latter half of this month.</li>
<li>2004/05/22 - Finally! I have finished the first draft of section 5. Continuing with the never ending battle against typos and minor enhancements,
I will start working on the final advanced section. Also, look for the inclusion of a useful grammar index soon.</li>
<li>2004/04/26 - I know there has been no new additions in a loooong time but I'm working on improving a lot of what's already there fixing a lot of
small (and big) typos, cross-referencing, etc.. I'm very close to finishing the next lesson (which I'm sure will be full of more typos, ugh) so stay tuned!</li>
<li>2004/04/26 - I was apparently smoking something
while I was writing the past tense verb conjugations because I completely missed one very important exception.
Review the <a href="negverb.html#part2">past tense page</a> to make sure I haven't confused you. Sorry... m(_ _)m</li>
<li>2004/03/27 - The more complete hiragana and katakana sections were merged from the textbook. I also took the textbook down because it became obvious
that it is a project that requires much more work than I anticipated. I decided to concentrate on this guide first before taking on such an ambitious project.</li>
<li>2004/02/14 - The guide gets a face-lift from plain, boring html to standards-compliant xhtml!
Wow, you know it's cool cause it has an 'x' in it.</li>
<li>2004/01/24 - Fixed the mucho typos.</li>
<li>2003/12/07 - Finally completed the first draft of section 4! Expect mucho typos until I revise it like a million times.</li>
<li>2003/12/04 - Wrote up a tentative outline for the remainder of the guide.  So much left to do!</li>
<li>2003/11/27 - Re-added frame version for those who really must have it.</li>
<li>2003/11/16 - Removed frames so that all pages can be easily reached from search engines.</li>
<li>2003/11/14 - The Japanese Grammar Guide finds its new home at www.geocities.jp at 500 yen a month.</li>
