<h2 id="part1">Events that occur right after</h2>
In this section, we will be covering some advanced grammar that describe an action that takes place right after something else has occurred.
I suggest you look over this section if you are really serious about completely mastering Japanese, or if you plan to take the level 1 JLPT exam, or
if you enjoy reading a lot of Japanese literature.

<h2 id="part2">Using 「が早いか」 to describe the instant something occurred</h2>
The phrase 「が早いか」 is used to describe something that happened the instant something else occurred.

<p>
It is more common to use the word 「すぐ」 with the te-form of the verb to describe the same type of thing but 「が早いか」 has a more instantaneous
nuance. In addition, unlike 「すぐ」, which simply means "soon", 「が早いか」 has several distinct characteristics.
</p>
<p>First of all, this grammar is used to describe an action that immediately occurs as a direct result of the first verb
so it is unnatural to use this grammar for unrelated or naturally occurring events.
For instance, you would not use it to say, "It started raining the moment we went out" because it was going to rain whether or not you went out.
In addition, this grammar is only used for things that have actually occurred and therefore always employs the past tense.
<a href="http://ws.31rsm.ne.jp/~toolware/dictionary/046.html">This site</a> gives a very detailed description of the particulars of this grammar.
</p>

<p>
To use this grammar, you attach 「が早いか」 to the first verb, then you describe the event that happened the next instant.
While it's conventional to use the non-past tense (dictionary form) for the first verb, you can also use the past tense.
For example, you can say either 「<em>言う</em>が早いか」 or 「<em>言った</em>が早いか」. The curious thing about this grammar is that the 「が」 particle comes right after the verb.
Remember, you can do this <i>only</i> with this specific grammatical phrase.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
（１）　彼女は、教授の姿を<em>見るが早いか</em>、教室から逃げ出した。
<br /> - The instant [she] saw the teacher's figure, [she] ran away from the classroom.
</p>


<p>
（２）　「食べてみよう」と<em>言うが早いか</em>、口の中に放り込んだ。
<br /> - The instant [he] said "let's try eating it", he threw [it] into his mouth.
</p>

<p>
（３）　「食べてみよう」と<em>言ったが早いか</em>、口の中に放り込んだ。
<br /> - The instant [he] said "let's try eating it", he threw [it] into his mouth.
</p>


<h2 id="part3">Using 「や／や否や」 to describe what happened right after</h2>
The 「や」 or 「や否や」（やいなや） phrase, when appended to a verb, is used to described something that happened right after that verb. Its meaning is essential the same as 「が早いか」.
It is also another type of grammar that is not really used in regular conversational Japanese.

<p>「否」 （read here as 「いな」） is a fancy Kanji for "no" used in words like 「否定」 and similar to 「不」. The literal meaning of this grammar is
"whether the action was taken or not". In order words, the second action is taken before you even take the time to determine whether the first event really happened or not.
</p>

<p>
You can use this grammar by attaching 「や」 or 「や否や」 to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred. Since this grammar is used for
events that already have occurred, the second verb is usually in the past tense. However, you can use the dictionary tense to indicate that the events
happen regularly. <a href="http://ws.31rsm.ne.jp/~toolware/dictionary/428.html">Refer to this site</a> to see more examples and details about this grammar.
</p>


<div class="sumbox">
<span class="summary">Using 「や／や否や」 to describe what happened right after</span>
<ul>
<li>Attach 「や」 or 「や否や」（やいなや） to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred
<br />例）　見る → 見<em>や</em>
<br />例）　見る → 見<em>や否や</em></li>
<li>This grammar is almost always used for events that actually happened (past tense).</li>
<li>This grammar can be used with the present tense for regularly occurring events.</li>
<li>Refer to <a href="http://ws.31rsm.ne.jp/~toolware/dictionary/428.html">this site</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
（１）　私の顔を<em>見るや</em>、何か言おうとした。
<br /> - [He] tried to say something as soon as he saw my face.
</p>


<p>
（２）　搭乗のアナウンスが<em>聞こえるや否や</em>、みんながゲートの方へ走り出した。
<br /> - As soon as the announcement to board was audible, everybody started running toward the gate.
</p>


<h2 id="part4">Using 「そばから」 to describe an event that repeatedly occurs soon after</h2>
「そばから」 is yet another grammar that describes an
event that happens right after another.  However, unlike the expressions we have covered so far, 「そばから」 implies that the
events are a recurring pattern. For example, you would use this grammar to express the fact that you just clean and clean your room only for
it to get dirty again soon after.

<p>
Besides this difference, the rules for using this expression is exactly the same as 「が早いか」 and 「や否や」. Just attach 「そばから」 to the
dictionary form of the first verb that occurred. The past tense, though rare, also appears to be acceptable. However, the event that immediately follows
is usually expressed with the non-past dictionary form because this grammar is used for repeated events and not a specific event in the past.
You can take a look at <a href="http://ws.31rsm.ne.jp/~toolware/dictionary/127.html">this site</a> for more details and examples.
</p>

<div class="sumbox">
<span class="summary">Using 「そばから」 to describe an event that repeatedly occurs soon after</span>
<ul>
<li>Attach 「そばから」 to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred
<br />例） 読む → 読む<em>そばから</em>
<br />例） する → する<em>そばから</em></li>
<li>This grammar implies that the events occur repeatedly.</li>
<li>Refer to <a href="http://ws.31rsm.ne.jp/~toolware/dictionary/127.html">this site</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
（１）　子供が掃除<em>するそばから</em>散らかすから、もうあきらめたくなった。
<br /> - The child messes up [the room] (repeatedly) as soon as I clean so I already became wanting to give up.
</p>


<p>
（２）　教科書を<em>読んだそばから</em>忘れてしまうので勉強ができない。
<br /> - Forget (repeatedly) right after I read the textbook so I can't study.
